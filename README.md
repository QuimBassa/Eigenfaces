# Eigenfaces

Academic project. Part of the Msc in Statistics and Operational Research at UPC-UB

## Summary
Eigenfaces is given name for the eigenvectors when appplyig a principal component analsyis to a collection of images. From a picture dataset of all the members of the parliament of 2008, we have performed an unsupervised learning technique to solve a human face recognition problem. The idea of the project was to detect the main facial features of all deputies, to later use a non-linear classifier to assess the gender from just the image of the representative.

The work aimed to demonstrate the statistical knowledge of multidimensional scaling and the use of the scikit-learn package in python.
